/**
 * IntelliJ Plugin to support primary developer actions for Buck based build and development using
 * the community version of IntelliJ 1.4*. The plugin supports multiple functions around integration
 * with core IntelliJ interactions and work flows. This plugin makes some initial assumptions around
 * project layout and structure that are specific to standard practice at Facebook but it is
 * intended that these be minimal.
